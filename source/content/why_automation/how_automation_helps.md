### How automation helps
:::{card} Healthy Reference

- **Version Control**: Automation ensures that every change is tracked, allowing teams to maintain a clear history of modifications. This helps in referencing previous versions easily.
- **Branching Strategies**: Automated workflows can enforce branching strategies (e.g., Git Flow), ensuring that features, fixes, and releases are organized and easily referenced.
:::
:::{card} Collaboration

- **Pull Requests and Merge Requests**: Automation facilitates code reviews through pull requests (GitHub) or merge requests (GitLab), allowing team members to collaborate effectively on code changes.
- **Notifications and Integrations**: Automated notifications keep team members informed about changes, discussions, and reviews, fostering better communication and collaboration.

:::
:::{card} Increased Quality

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated testing ensures that code changes are validated against a suite of tests before being merged, reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs.
- **Code Quality Checks**: Automation tools can enforce coding standards and perform static code analysis, helping maintain high-quality codebases.

:::
:::{card} Transparency

- **Audit Trails**: Automation provides a clear audit trail of who made changes, when, and why, enhancing accountability and transparency in the development process.
- **Visibility into Workflows**: Automated pipelines and dashboards provide real-time insights into the status of builds, tests, and deployments, making it easier for stakeholders to understand project progress.

:::
:::{card} Reproducibility

- **Automated Builds and Deployments**: Automation allows for consistent builds and deployments, ensuring that the same code can be reliably reproduced in different environments.
- **Environment Configuration**: Tools like Docker can be integrated into automated workflows, allowing developers to define and replicate environments easily, enhancing reproducibility.
