- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: 
  - Automated testing ensures that code **changes are validated against a suite of tests** before being merged, reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs.
  - Automation helps **catch conflicts before they reach the healthy reference** by running tests on local merge commits
- **Branching Strategies**: Automated workflows can enforce branching strategies (e.g., Feature Branch Approach), ensuring that features, fixes, and releases are organized and easily referenced.
