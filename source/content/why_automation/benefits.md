## Why Offer <i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i> **GitLab** and <i class="fab fa-github"></i> **GitHub**, etc. Automation?

{% if page %}
Automation in platforms like **GitLab** and **GitHub** plays a crucial role in enhancing various aspects of software development.
It{% else %}Automation{% endif %} offers significant advantages across various fields beyond software development, including scientific research, data analysis, and project management.

{% if page %}
Automating **repetitive tasks** lets developers focus on **strategic work**, streamlining development and **reducing human error** in testing, building, and deployment for **reliable outcomes**. 
Automation of the delivery pipeline—from **code commit to production**—enables **faster releases**.
In an academic setting, an automated delivery pipeline can help researchers **publish findings** more quickly.

**Automation fosters collaboration** by smoothly integrating team contributions. 
In research, it can help **share data** and **results** across teams, enhancing **transparency** and **reproducibility**.
**CI/CD practices** ensure consistent **testing and deployment environments**, reducing **environment-specific issues**. 
This is crucial in research, where **reproducibility** is key and facilitates contributions by other researchers because they can easily replicate the work.
**Automated testing** provides **immediate feedback**, allowing for **quicker iterations** and **continuous improvement**.
Research projects can benefit from this by quickly identifying issues and making necessary adjustments to the code or data.
For growing projects, automation **manages complex workflows** and large teams, supporting **scalability**.
CI/CD practices facilitate the reproducibility of research results by ensuring that the code and data are consistent across different environments.

**Continuous integration and testing** maintain **high code quality** and **reliability**, ensuring software meets **user expectations**.
