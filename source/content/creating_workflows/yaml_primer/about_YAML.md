### What is YAML

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files and data exchange between languages with different data structures.
Its simplicity and readability make it a popular choice for defining workflows in platforms like **GitHub** and **GitLab**.

- **Configuration Files**: Many applications and services, such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible, use YAML for configuration due to its clear syntax.
- **Data Serialization**: YAML is often used to serialize data structures in programming languages, making it easier to read and write complex data.
- **API Specifications**: Tools like Swagger (OpenAPI) utilize YAML to define API specifications, allowing for easy documentation and sharing of API endpoints.
