# Exercise

In this exercise, you will work on a LaTeX article with a bibliography. 
You will learn how to set-up an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to compile the LaTeX document and publish it as a PDF file.
This setup will ensure that your document is consistently compiled with all the necessary dependencies and configurations.

By the end of this exercise, you will have a practical workflow that enhances your productivity and ensures the quality of your LaTeX documents.

Go to the [LaTeX Article CI/CD Template Repository](https://github.com/matteodelucchi/latex-article-template) and follow the instructions in the README.
